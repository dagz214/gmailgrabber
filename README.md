# GmailGrabber

An automation tool that utilizes the [simplegmail](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail) repo. The goal was/is to enable downloading and manipulating email attachments that are repetitive in nature such as bills. The goal now has expanded to more automation possibilities such as deleting, tagging, etc, and all with a very simple ```.yaml``` input.

## Use Case

Let's say you need to get all your receipts from Microsoft, from the last 6 months, and send it to your accountant.
You have a Microsoft 365 Standard account + a Microsoft 365 Basic account.
Fetch all of those receipts with this SIMPLE ```.yaml```:

```yaml
- Office 365 Basic:
    scenario_class: attdownloader
    query_params:
      sender: microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com
      attachment: True
      exact_phrase: microsoft 365 business basic
      months_back: 6
      
- Office 365 Standard:				#just a name
    scenario_class: attdownloader	#the type of scenario, in this case its "attachment download"
    query_params:					#what to look for:
      sender: microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com	#the sender of the message
      attachment: True							#the messeage has an attachment
      exact_phrase: microsoft 365 business standard #the message contains this phrase
      months_back: 6 #how far to look back
```

This would not only download your attachment, but will also rename the files to easy to understand, and date-sortable filenames.

Additional functionality for ```query_params```Â mentioned in [simplegmail/query.py](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail/blob/master/simplegmail/query.py).

## Usage

1. Create ```client_secret.json``` and ```gmail_token.json``` file as described in [simplegmail](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail) GitHub documentation
